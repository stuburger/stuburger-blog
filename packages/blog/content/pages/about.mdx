## About this blog

Hi, my name is Stuart Bourhill and this is my about page. I enjoy writing about the things I'm interested in. Generally that's tech stuff. I like writing because:

- **Writing helps me form and articulate my opinions.** Who was it that said "*if you're not writing you're not thinking."*? When I heard that quote, I immediately knew it to be true. I have found time and time again that if I don't write down my thoughts on a topic, then trying to talk about that subject can be extremely difficult. "What do you think about X?" I may rattle off some stuff that I've heard before but somehow articulating what I _actually_ think, seems frustratingly just out of grasp. Like trying to pick up a fully inflated football in one hand (at least in one of _my_ hands). The words can feel like they're slipping away and I fail to do my thoughts justice. 
  
  I hope this blog helps me round out my thoughts so that when I have the opportunity to talk about them I don't feel like I am constantly straddling the territory between knowing my shit and completely fucking winging it.
  
- I love to teach and I love to help create lightbulb moments in others. Just as I love the feeling of being empowered when I've learn something new, you know, when I finally "get it", I also get a total kick out of knowing that I have been instrumental in helping others feel the same! 

- I want to be a better engineer. I think one of the most undervalued skills in software engineering is the ability to communicate their ideas in writing. Writing isn't just an activity performed in retrospect either. Remember the quote above about the relationship between *writing* and *thinking*? Keep that in mind during your next technical refinement.
