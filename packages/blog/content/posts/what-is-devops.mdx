Development goals are: Rapid release (new features, bug fixes, etc)
Operations goals: Stable systems (availability, etc)

- Shorten development lifecycle
- deliver features, fixes, and updates frequently

CI / CD?

Continuous delivery vs continuous deployment. The difference is literally a button click.
